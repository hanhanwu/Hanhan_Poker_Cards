ğŸŒ» He opened the first box, there is an invisible scent came out and surrounded him. He was very excited. Wherever he went, the scent was accompanied him closely. But very soon, he started to get bored, feeling losing the freedom, and sometimes, he even wanted to escape by running fast, hoping there could be a few moments he could stay alone.
